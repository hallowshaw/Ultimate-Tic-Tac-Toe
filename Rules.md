# Ultimate Tic Tac Toe Rules

Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is a variation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe, with an added layer of strategy and complexity. Here are the rules:

1. **Board Structure**: Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is played on a 3x3 grid of 3x3 grids. This means there are nine smaller Tic Tac Toe boards, arranged in a 3x3 grid. Each smaller board is referred to as a "local board".

2. **Starting the Game**: The game starts with an empty Ultimate Tic Tac Toe board.

3. **Gameplay**:

   - Players take turns placing their symbol (usually X or O) in any empty square on any of the local boards.
   - The local board on which a player places their symbol determines the next local board where their opponent must play.
   - For example, if Player 1 places their symbol in the top-right square of a local board, then Player 2 must play in the local board corresponding to the top-right square on the overall board.

4. **Winning a Local Board**: The objective of each local board is the same as traditional Tic Tac Toe: players aim to get three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
5. **Winning the Game**:

   - To win the game, a player must win three local boards in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
   - If a local board results in a tie, it is considered neutral and does not count towards any player's victory condition.

6. **Forcing a Move**:

   - If a player is sent to a local board where all the squares are already filled or where a winning condition has been achieved, they can choose to play in any empty square on the overall board.
   - This gives the opponent the advantage of choosing the local board where they want to play next.

7. **Game End**: The game ends when one player wins by completing three local boards in a row, or when all squares on the overall board are filled, resulting in a draw.

Ultimate Tic Tac Toe requires strategic planning not only for each individual local board but also for the overall game. Players must consider both their immediate moves and their opponent's potential moves to secure victory.

In short, the steps are as follow:-

1. **Board Setup**: The game is played on a 3x3 grid, with each cell containing another 3x3 grid, totaling 9 smaller grids.

2. **Starting**: The game begins with all cells empty.

3. **Taking Turns**: Players alternate turns, placing their symbol (X or O) in any empty cell within any smaller grid.

4. **Next Move**: The cell a player chooses determines the smaller grid where the opponent must play next.

5. **Winning**: Players aim to win three smaller grids in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

6. **Tie**: If a smaller grid is full or has a winning condition, players can play in any empty cell of the larger grid.

7. **Game End**: The game ends when one player wins three smaller grids in a row or when all cells of the larger grid are filled.
